# Data Scraping and Machine Learning
This project demonstrates a full life-cycle a data science product, from data collection to data analytics and machine learning. First, a web scraping script is run to collect product data from a fashion retailer's website. Next, basic data cleaning and analytic are performed to evaluate and explore the dataset. Lastly, logistic regression is deloyed to determine if a new product will likely to be populare. 

## 1. HTML Webpage Scraping
I will divide the data scraping section into two parts because the data I'm interested in are displayed in two different manners. For products in the same category, it's easy to go to a product category page and scrap all the product name, url, image, price and sku information. All these information exists in one single webpage. However, this dosen't have more detailed product information such as product description. The second part will be scraping detailed product information that exists on multiple webpages. 

### Scraping Part 1
1. open this url (https://www.anntaylor.com/dresses/cata000012?goToPage=2&N=0) in your web broswer;
2. bring out the javascript console; 
3. run function in `data_scraping.js` in your javascript console; 
4. organize the data collected into csv or json
5. organize all the product url columns into a list

### Scraping Part 2
1. bring out the javascript console; 
2. run function in `product_scraping.js` in your javascript console; 
3. organize the data collected into csv or json

## 2. Data Exploration
1. get data into csv format 


## 3. Logistic Regression
